NT politician Gerry Wood blames abortion for GST cuts

Published: May 5 2017 - 10:37AM

Independent Northern Territory politician Gerry Wood has blamed abortions for the loss of millions of dollars in GST revenue due to glacial population growth.

The Territory's GST share has been slashed by $269 million next financial year, which the Labor government projects will blow out to $2 billion over four years.

During a parliamentary debate about the NT budget, Mr Wood said $77 million of that cut was linked to a reduction in the Territory's share of Australia's population growth.

"We lose 600 to 1,000 people (each year) through abortion," he said.

"If population is decreasing, so will GST. That is the fact."

The staunch anti-abortion campaigner suggested pregnant women could help solve the NT's economic problems by exploring the "alternatives".
