Innocents burnt in the flames of green ideology

YOU can’t overlook the deadly green ideas that contributed to the tragic Grenfell Tower fire in London.

Aluminium composite cladding was applied to the building last May, not just for its good looks but as a sustainable energy solution to achieve green ticks in the carbon-obsessed British regulatory system.

As the management company running the 24-storey tower, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, declared in its strategic report about the refurbishment: “All of this will greatly enhance the energy efficiency of the building.”

The flammable insulation was designed to improve energy efficiency and all signs point to the fact that it accelerated the fire, acting as a chimney to draw vertical flames up the building trapping residents at the top.

Fears were raised in the U.K. Telegraph last week that green energy concerns to satisfy carbon emission targets were prioritised ahead of safety.

“It could be that this is the quest for sustainability trumping other concerns,” said Dr Jim Glockling, Technical Director of the UK Fire Protection Association.

In Australia, cheap flammable Chinese aluminium composite cladding has led to building fires.

Green ideology has given us sky high electricity prices, deadly pink batts and now flammable cladding.
