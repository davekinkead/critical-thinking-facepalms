# Critical Thinking Facepalms

> Demonstrable proof that we need more critical thought in politics, business, and society.

This project is an attempt to collect, collate, and curate examples of embarrassingly bad, face palm inducing reasoning.  

One day soonish, I'll build a searchable interface to make the purveyors of poor thought easier to find.  Unitl then however, you'll need to trawl the headlines in [`/facepalms`](/facepalms).

If you'd like to contribute (to the list curation, not the bad thinking), create a pull request with your example (both text and screenshot) or send me an email with a link to dave at kinkead dot com dot au.
